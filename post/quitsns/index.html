I wish I had never seen that photo, but here I am. I know certainly there is a place in hell for people who caused and braindeadly supported and justified this. To this day, I still don&rsquo;t know what exactly happened in Tangshan, all the words I have seen are woven into a narrative so terrifying that I dare not click on any of the related videos. I wouldn&rsquo;t even care what really happened. Why do I even need to know what exactly happened? Why are these people so obsessed with the &ldquo;truth&rdquo; from the offical in a place where there is no free press? Aren&rsquo;t these things powerful enough to speak for themselves?<p style=text-align:center><img src=/sitalone_chengdu.jpg alt></p></p></article><nav role=navigation class="flex-container bottom-menu"><hr><p><a href=/about>about</a>
