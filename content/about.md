Hello, I'm Rui (Lucas) Zhu [`u+9510`](https://util.unicode.org/UnicodeJsps/character.jsp?a=9510) [`u+6731`](https://util.unicode.org/UnicodeJsps/character.jsp?a=6731), and you are?

I have slick minimalist templates for list pages (such as a list of blog posts) and single pages (a page to read one blog post). You can use tags on your content, and view content by tags.

I also have a simple responsive gallery feature. It'll look great on any screen, and all you have to do is provide a folder of images.

If you want to get really fancy, you can add an option video background to my main page.

I'm built and maintained by [Victoria Drake](lucas/) and a lovely team of [contributors](https://github.com/victoriadrake/hugo-theme-sam/graphs/contributors).

This page uses the default `baseof.html` template.
